# odin-todo
Repo for the todo list project in the javascript course of the Odin Project

## Process  

- As always, my first step will be designing the UI via freeform and text  

### Design 

- The todos themselves will be made up of:
    - Category (assign icons)
    - Title
    - Description
    - Due Date
    - Repeat?
- I am thinking cards in a grid style
- Thought of the name 'bullitin board' and that will influence the design as well
- <img src="design/Screenshot 2023-09-21 at 8.36.29 PM.png">

### Progress

9/21/23-9/24/23
- Implementing html to achieve above "macro" design -- revisit freeform for subdesigns (forms for entry, on-click todo)
